This Github repo explores the collection of data from this website: https://population.un.org/dataportal.

This website features an interactive display to explore data. They also feature an api to extract the data from. This repo explores how to use this api to collect meaningful data to then perform your own analyses. The code is in part based on the instructions found on the website: https://population.un.org/dataportal/about/dataapi
